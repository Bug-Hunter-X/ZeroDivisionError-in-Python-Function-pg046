This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that causes this error.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution by implementing exception handling to gracefully manage the division by zero scenario. This is a crucial aspect of robust Python programming.
